# the-ESF-Signature-Scheme
Coding, console and data.

We run 100 times key generation operation and each key generation operation, we run 100 times signing operation and 100 times verifying operation for the FDH signature scheme and the ESF signature scheme.


The simulations are done in the platform Python 3.7 Intel Core i5-8250U 1.80GHz 4GB RAM. We ﬁx the parameters p and q of both of the schemes to 1536 bit lengths. The public keys u and of our scheme are ﬁxed to 30 bit lengths.


The results of coding, its consoles and the complete data
are included in here.
